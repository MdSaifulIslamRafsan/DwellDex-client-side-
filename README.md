# Interactive Navigation:
Implemented with React Router DOM, the website offers seamless navigation between different pages, allowing users to easily access key sections such as:
- Home: The central hub where users can explore residential property listings, access essential information, and navigate various sections of the website.
- Update Profile: Exclusive to logged-in users, this route allows individuals to update their profile information, ensuring personalized experiences and enhanced user engagement.
- User Profile: Available to logged-in users, this route showcases user-specific details, such as saved searches, favorite listings, and personalized recommendations, enhancing user interaction and satisfaction.

- View Property: When users click to view property details, the route dynamically adjusts based on their login status. If logged in, users are directed to the property details page for comprehensive information. Otherwise, they are redirected to the login page, ensuring seamless access to property listings while maintaining security and privacy.
- React-Leaflet: React-Leaflet enhances our website by seamlessly integrating interactive maps into our property listings. With its features, users can explore property locations, conduct location-based searches, and visualize nearby amenities with ease, empowering them to make informed decisions about their residential choices.
